## About
Publish was started in 2011 by Danielkrahofer [dnilabs](http://labs.agency/) and improved since then. In 2013 in cooperation with [Qupik](http://qupik.com/) and [AWS](http://www.awsg.at/) a lot of active development was funded to bring Publish! to a ready to use status for our customers.
dnilabs will continue tho improve Publish!, because we are passionate about Opensource and Javascript and we use CMS Systems written in php on a daily basis in our job.
